# Quick Start

If you want to give Responsio a quick try without having to set up a web server, you can do so using the command line tools. After downloading/cloning the repository, issue the following commands from the root level of the repository (the directory that contains the <code>README.md</code> file).

<pre>
> ant install  
> ./script/train
> ./script/chat
</pre>

You can use also use <code>mvn install</code> or <code>gradle install</code> instead of <code>ant install</code>.
