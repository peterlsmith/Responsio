/**
 * {@link com.paradoxwebsolutions.assistant.Action} implementations. 
 * <p>This package contains concrete implementations of the {@link com.paradoxwebsolutions.assistant.Action} interface
 * - code that is executed in response to client input when identified as part of a 
 * story. In most cases, the action is 
 * simply an utterance (a textual answer to a question), but more complex actions
 * may be implemented, such as retrieving data from a database, etc.
