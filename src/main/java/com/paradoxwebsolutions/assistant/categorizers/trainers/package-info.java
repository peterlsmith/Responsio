/**
 * Categorizer training classes. 
 * <p>This package contains code related to the training of categorizers. Training
 * generally refers to the process of taking a special dataset and generating models
 * that can be used by a categorizer, as is the case of the default OpenNLP categorizer.
 * However, not all categorizers require trainers - for example, the Regex training is
 * explicity configured rather than trained.
